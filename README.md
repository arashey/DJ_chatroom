### Chatroom Application  
This is a real-time chatroom application built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework**. It allows users to register, log in, and join chatrooms to send and receive messages. Key features include:  

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.  
- **Chatrooms**: Users can create, search, and join chatrooms.  
- **Messaging**: Real-time messaging with timestamps. Users can delete their own messages.  
- **API Integration**: RESTful APIs for managing chatrooms and messages.  
- **Dynamic Frontend**: A responsive interface with JavaScript handling live updates.  

This project demonstrates modern web development principles and serves as a foundation for more advanced chat applications. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
